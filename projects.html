                    <p>I worked with my 20-year-old sister to create TheCityOfSam blog, so she can share her love of vegan food, fashion, music, female empowerment and health. To set up her page quickly, I used squarespace. Also, using sqaurespace made it easy to teach her how to edit the site. We have continued to work on it since May 2017. My main duty is to customize the css to match what she envisions for each page, but I also take photos and create new content with her. Check it out <a href="https://www.thecityofsam.com">here</a> and read her blog post about me <a href="https://www.thecityofsam.com/home/femalefriday">here</a>!</p>

                    <div class = "project-text"> <a href="https://uptake.com">Uptake</a> is a predictive analytics company working in the industrial space. They collect data from a company's assets and predict failures, improve efficiency and ensure safety. During my internship at Uptake, I gained a lot of experience working with Apache Kafka, a platform for data streaming. I wrote part of a micro service that produces and consumes records to and from a topic whenever a change in Uptake's data occurs. There were many records in the topic, so I also worked to "compact" them. I worked with KafkaStreams, KTables, and Global KTables.
<br>
I helped Uptake maintain a working code base by writing web tests using Selenium tests and integration tests using Mockito. Selenium automates browsers so you can write a test that will click on different elements in the DOM and assert the code is working the way it is suppose to. Mockito was useful for creating and configuring mock objects and verify specific conditions were met.
<br>
I worked with Docker to migrate our system from reseeding Casandra, Kafka, ElasticSearch and Postgres every build to creating a snapshot of each to run instead. This made the build process twice as fast and thus also more successful.
<br>
I joined a small, specialized team to model our pipeline in an easy, coherent way to tell which part of the pipeline there were bottlenecks or failures. It should make tracking our data easier and our company more efficient overall.

I got to practice those skills by working on a few websites, including <a href = "http://www.pop-post.com">Pop-post.com </a> and <a href = "http://www.deathaday.com">deathaday.com</a>. I created the podcast page for <a href = "http://www.pop-post.com">Pop-post.com</a> which should be launching this fall and added many features to the current site. I designed and created deathaday.com. This page corresponds to an app, Dearly Departed, which I also worked on in swift.

                    <div class="project-text"> I took a UI class where we were assigned a project to create a working website that will help students at the University of Michigan. We came up with LectureHelper();, which is a place where students can ask or answer questions in class, and instructors can get feedback on how class is going so that they can adjust the material accordingly. Our app has three main components: the queue of student in-class questions, three quick-click feedback buttons and in-class poll for instructor use. It is in-class because the whole page would only be valid during lecture times. <br> For the front-end aspect of our web application, we used HTML and JavaScript with AngularJS as our framework. We chose MySQL for the database to store the data for each question, quick click buttons counts, and poll results, and we used Flask as our backend to communicate with JavaScript and MySQL. Our website is being hosted on an AWS EC2 instance using gunicorn to serve the python (on port 3000) and nginx (port 80) to serve the HTML and JavaScript. <br> The biggest reason for our application is that in-class forum creates a better learning environment and stimulates students to think more critically while receiving new knowledge. It's also incredibly important for the teach to know how the class feels about material.
